chrubuntu_fixes
===============

Various fixes for Chrubuntu (specifically aimed at the ARM model Chromebook, although compatible with intel-based x86-64 Chromebooks).

To fix the eratic behaviour of the trackpad in ChrUbuntu, simply clone this
repository and execute the script.

The script by default will set a "gb" keyboard map, simply uncomment the bottom
line for a US key map.

The script is *very* simple, and it does the following:

Backs up your X config to a folder called "backup" in your home directory

Moves into the X config directory

Downloads my X config files as a zip archive

Unzips the archive, and then deletes it

(then the optional keymap part)
